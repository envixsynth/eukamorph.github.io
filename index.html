                Hello, this is Envix and I will be your guide for this webpage you've happened to stumble upon. This is a site for entertainment. Personal entertainment, very personal. However this "inter-net" is a good way to extricate that personal stuff into other dimensions and temporal modalities. I created eukamorph.com with the intention to spread cool stuff around, and if you like what you see then stick around. Stay tuned for more updates. There are always updates, of some form or another.

            <p>This is a page dedicated to all the wonderful creations of nature. We here at eukamorph.com define "nature" as everything that exists. If it doesn't exist, it doesn't belong here. If you believe you have a wonderful creation of nature (any form, doesn't matter), then please contact me with what you've got. Tell me where it came from, how it came to be, how you came to behold it, and how you came to bring it to me. Whether you created it yourself or discovered it elsewhere in nature, I will post the content here if I deem it wonderful.
