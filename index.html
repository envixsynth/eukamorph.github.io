            <h1>Welcome to the Eukamorph Portal</h1>
            <p>This is a site for design, collaboration, and transformation. <strike>Visit our Contact page to submit a design</strike> (nvm, that doesn't work currently), or request collaboration with another designer. We here at Eukamorph design all sorts of things virtual. From visual/graphic arts to music and sound design. There will be more designs of other forms to come in the future. You may become a Eukamorph member simply by submitting a design or being invited into the community.</p>

            <h1>Some things we have</h1>
            <p1>Currently we have some music and some pictures. You can browse our content of designs by artist. Yes, pretty basic at the moment. Expect to have more to come shortly.</p1>
             <div id="break1"></div>
            <h2>Some things we plan to have</h2>
            <p2>We plan to have more to come in the future. IRC chat box, cloud server/repo dump for easy content access/distribution, INTERACTIVE MODULES, profile pages, membership forums probably, and more. As collaboration continues, we expect to have more content of all sorts filling the site in time. This contribution will aid in the eukamorphization process. Feel free to submit any kind of design you like (as soon as the contact section works). Once some profile pages are up, it will be easier for members to collaborate through the Eukamorph portal.</p2>
